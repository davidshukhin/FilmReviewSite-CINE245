                "The Shape of Water" is an enchanting and lyrical fairy tale set against the backdrop of Cold War era America, circa 1962. 
                It follows the story of Eliza, a mute woman who works as a janitor in a high-security government laboratory. 
                Elisa's life takes a drastic turn when she and co-worker Zelda discover a classified experiment stored in one of the rooms.
                The experiment is an Amphibian Man, with whom Eliza immediately empathizes. Aided by her coworker Zelda and neighbor Giles, Eliza devises a bold plan to free him.

                Together, they successfully execute a risky escape and hide the creature in Elizaâ€™s apartment, planning to release him into the ocean once conditions allow. 
                As they evade the relentless pursuit of Strickland, a corrupt Colonel in charge of safeguarding the Amphibian Man, Eliza and the Amphibian Man form a deep emotional bond that blossoms into love, challenging conventional norms and culminating in a dramatic resolution.
