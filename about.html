            <h2>Interpretive Essay</h2>
            <p>
                The bathroom sequence towards the beginning of Guillermo Del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” does an excellent job of introducing the film's critique of social dynamics and oppression. It begins with two women(one with a disability, and the other who is black) cleaning up the urine of the white men who work at the government facility. This can already be interpreted symbolically. The white man, in his arrogance and self-righteousness leaves a mess everywhere he goes and then leaves it to the underprivileged to clean it up. Del Toro and cinematographer Dan Laustsen masterfully utilize visual storytelling to subtly but clearly continue transmitting this message. When Strickland enters the scene, he disrupts Eliza and Zelda’s laughter and the camera moves in towards him, keeping him framed in the center and at a low-angle, reinforcing his dominating presence.

                Strickland then places a taser-like object down on the sink, which later in the scene he explains is a cattle prod. The cattle prod is a phallic symbol and represents Strickland’s power and the patriarchy he upholds. The symbol serves to further establish the hierarchy that the rest of the movie critiques and eventually uproots when Eliza breaks social norms by falling in love with the Amphibian Man and orchestrating his escape. After placing down the cattle prod, Strickland talks to Eliza and Zelda while urinating, telling us that he exists in a world where he doesn’t need to care about how marginalized groups perceive him. It is an act of disrespect but also an action that will have absolutely no negative consequences for Strickland.

                Throughout the entire scene Strickland is always framed either at the forefront or at the edge of the frame. When the camera is focussed on him he has complete dominance of the image, and even in the shots that are focussed on Eliza and Zelda, we can always make out his outline at the edge of the frame. This outline traps Eliza and Zelda on the side of the image, further highlighting their identity as a marginalized group. Another subtlety is that whenever Strickland moves around the bathroom, Eliza always steps away from him and the door, further emphasizing the dynamic between them.

                Another detail that Del Toro uses is having Strickland emphasize how he doesn’t wash his hands after urinating. It literally suggests that Strickland’s hands are dirty, and upon exiting the bathroom Eliza finds that he has left a few drops of blood behind. The combination of the Amphibian Man’s blood and Strickland's dirty hands reveals the larger allegory at play. Strickland is a representation of the suffocating white male hierarchy and the Amphibian Man represents something different from the norm. He is someone who doesn’t fit into the existing boxes and threatens the patriarchy Strickland upholds. Strickland then has no issue using force to suppress the threat, which is showcased here by his dirty hands.
