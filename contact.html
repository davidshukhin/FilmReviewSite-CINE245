            <h2>Film Review</h2>
            <p>
                Spanish film director Guillermo Del Toro reminds us of his mastery of the modern fairy tale with his film “The Shape of Water.” Set amidst the bleakness of Cold War America, Del Toro crafts a beautiful story reminding us of the transformative nature of love. There is no better way to sum up The Shape Of Water than its closing quote, a poem written by Hakim Sanai, a Sufi mystic that Del Toro found while digging around in an old bookstore at the time of shooting the film. “Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with your love. It humbles my heart, for you are everywhere.” To a Sufi, God is no different than Love, and Del Toro asks us to open our hearts to this universal presence by presenting one of the most unconventional love stories of our day.

                The film takes place in 1962, following a mute woman named Eliza, who works as a cleaning lady at a secret government laboratory. One day, a new specimen is brought into the laboratory, an Amphibian Man (Doug Jones), who is brutally tortured and kept locked up. Eliza forms a connection with him, and she and her coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) orchestrate his escape. Eliza falls in love with the Amphibian Man, with Sally Hawkins' performance perfectly expressing the radical transformative power of love. Eliza becomes expressive and cheerful. This love is like the love described by Hakim Sanai. It’s real and unconditional, and most importantly, formless. Eliza doesn’t judge the outer form of the sea creature but instead focuses on their shared inner nature. Beautiful special effects are used to elevate Doug Jones' performance, such as a blue light that lights up the Amphibian Man, portraying that he too, thinks and feels things. Del Toro reminds us that the nature of love is just like water, formless and purifying.

                This motif of water is used quite powerfully from the get-go. The movie opens with Eliza’s apartment completely submerged in water, Eliza slowly drifting down into her bed before being startled awake by her alarm clock and waking up to a normal reality. Her apartment is covered with cool tones of cyan and blue, foreshadowing the magical encounter with the sea that is to come.

                One of the most powerful moments of the film is when Del Toro masterfully has Eliza break her silence when professing her love for the Amphibian Man. As she attempts to speak, we explode into a fantastical world where Eliza sings a musical-style piece to her lover. The scene is shot in black and white and highlights how fantasy elements are used to elevate the emotional parts of the film.

                The Shape of Water has many parallels to Del Toro’s other signature work, his 2006 film Pan’s Labyrinth. There is a similar motif of an oppressive male authority, Vidal in Pan’s Labyrinth and Strickland in Shape of Water, and female characters resisting him, Ofelia and Eliza. However, in Pan’s Labyrinth, Del Toro uses fantasy as a means of escape from a cruel world, while in The Shape of Water the fantastical elements are not so much an escape, but an invitation to rediscover beauty in the bleakest of moments. The Shape of Water is also simpler in its storytelling and conveys the maturation of Del Toro’s style as he’s learned to say more with less.

                Ultimately, "The Shape of Water" is not just a film but a poignant reminder of the essence of love. Del Toro, through his unique lens as a filmmaker, invites us to rediscover love in the most unexpected places. This film is a testament to his continued growth as a director and his ability to convey profound universal truths through the art of cinema.
